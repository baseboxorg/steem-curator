      <p class="card-text">Steem Curator is an effort to help the community with my knowledge of technology and steem economy.
      The goal of this project will always be to maximize your curation earnings by scanning through various bot activities to find
      best content to up-vote before major votes fall in so you earn curation reward for every vote that you cast.</p>

      <br>
      <h5 class="card-title">Feature 1: Comments Curation</h5>
      <p>This module looks through the current bids of 16 bots which support comment up-voting and displays the result for easy curation.
      I also added two links, one for steemit.com and other for busy.org. If you use busy.org, you can set voting % so you can cast more votes
      without depleting your voting power a lot. Even a small up-vote before the bigger votes gets you a decent share of curation pie.</p>

      <br>
      <h5 class="card-title">Feature 2: Utopian Posts</h5>
      <p>Utopian Posts module helps in 2 different ways. One it provides for easier sorting and readability to the data on utopian site
        and Secondly Utopian posts are great for curation. These are posts that add value to the opensource community and most of them will
        get a vote from utopian guaranteeing a definite curation reward.</p>
